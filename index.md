# Welcome to the LegoLib Documentation  
{: .d-inline-block }  

This website will hopefully contain all the information you need to use LegoLib in your own projects.  

LegoLib is a Minecraft mod developed for Fabric. It helps mod developers to create mods easier by using functions that are used in most mods. It also allows players to create resource packs that change textures based on the entity's name.  

Visit [Curseforge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/legolib/files) to download the mod!
