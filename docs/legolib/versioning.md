# Versioning  
{: .d-inline-block }  

LegoLib has four release types.  
  - `ALPHA`  
  - `BETA`  
  - `RELEASE_CANDIDATE`  
  - `RELEASE`  

`ALPHA` releases are early in development.  
`ALPHA` releases will often will contain bugs, and/or unfinished code.  

`BETA` releases are nearing the end of development.  
`BETA` releases may still contain bugs, and/or unfinished code.  

`RELEASE_CANDIDATE` releases are the final stage of development before release.  
`RELEASE CANDIDATE` releases are the most polished development builds.  
If no bugs are found `RELEASE_CANDIDATE` releases will turn into the final `RELEASE` release.  

`RELEASE` releases are the final stable version.  
`RELEASE` releases are less likely to contain bugs.
