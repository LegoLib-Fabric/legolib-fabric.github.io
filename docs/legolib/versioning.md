|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|  
| `ALPHA`             | `ALPHA` releases are early in development and will often will contain bugs, and/or unfinished code.                                                                                                                        |  
| `BETA`              | `BETA` releases are nearing the end of development and may still contain bugs, and/or unfinished code.                                                                                                                     |  
| `RELEASE_CANDIDATE` | `RELEASE_CANDIDATE` releases are the final stage of development before release and are the most polished development builds. If no bugs are found `RELEASE_CANDIDATE` releases will turn into the final `RELEASE` release. |  
| `RELEASE`           | `RELEASE` releases are the final stable version and are less likely to contain bugs.                                                                                                                                       |
