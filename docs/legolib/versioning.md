### Minor Version  

LegoLib's minor version changes every full release cycle.  

### Patch Version

### Release Types

LegoLib has four release types.  


| Release Type        | Short Code |  Long Code           | Description                                                                                                                                                                          |  
|:--------------------|:-----------|:---------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|  
| Alpha               | `alpha`    |  `ALHPA`             | These releases are early in development and will often will contain bugs, and/or unfinished code.                                                                                    |  
| Beta                | `beta`     |  `BETA`              | These releases are nearing the end of development and may still contain bugs, and/or unfinished code.                                                                                |  
| Release Candidate   | `rc`       |  `RELEASE_CANDIDATE` | These releases are the final stage of development before release and are the most polished development builds. If no bugs are found these releases will turn into the final release. |  
| Release             | `release`  |  `RELEASE`           | These releases are the final stable version and are less likely to contain bugs.                                                                                                     |
